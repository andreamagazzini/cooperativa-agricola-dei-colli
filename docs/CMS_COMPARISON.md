## My Specific Recommendation

**For Cooperativa Agricola dei Colli:**

1. **Short term:** Start with **Airtable**
   - Quick setup
   - Easy for farmers/cooperative members to update
   - Free tier covers your product catalog
   - Upgrade later if needed

2. **Long term:** Consider **Sanity** if you need:
   - Rich product descriptions
   - Blog/news section
   - Better image galleries
   - More content features

## Implementation

The Next.js conversion I'm doing will work with **any** of these options. The API structure will be the same:

```
Next.js App → API Route → CMS API → Return Data
```

You can switch CMS later without changing your frontend code much!
